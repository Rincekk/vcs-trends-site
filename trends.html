  <h1>Modern Trends and Ecosystem in Version Control</h1>

  <h2>Hosting & Social Coding Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and others provide cloud‑hosted Git repositories, web interfaces, social features (stars, forks), issue tracking, and collaboration tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Workflows & Collaboration</h2>
  <p>
    Modern development workflows often revolve around pull requests (or merge requests), code review, and branching strategies such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Feature branching</li>
    <li>Git Flow / GitHub Flow</li>
    <li>Trunk / mainline / trunk-based development</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Automation & CI/CD Integration</h2>
  <p>
    Integration of VCS with continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and automated checks (linting, tests, static analysis) is standard in modern development environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Trends</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Monorepos and code organization at scale</li>
    <li>Large binary / LFS support (e.g. Git LFS)</li>
    <li>Security and compliance (branch protection, signed commits)</li>
    <li>Integration with project management, issue trackers, and DevOps tooling</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In summary, the modern VCS ecosystem is not just about storing code history — it’s deeply intertwined with collaboration, automation, and delivery pipelines.

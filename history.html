  <h1>History of Version Control Systems</h1>
  
  <p>The evolution of version control systems is marked by successive generations. Below is a simplified timeline of key systems:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>RCS</strong> (Revision Control System) — early system for individual file versioning.</li>
    <li><strong>CVS</strong> (Concurrent Versions System) — brought versioning across multiple files and basic collaboration.</li>
    <li><strong>Subversion (SVN)</strong> — a centralized VCS aiming to fix shortcomings of CVS (atomic commits, directory versioning).</li>
    <li><strong>Mercurial & Git</strong> — distributed version control systems enabling full local clones, high performance, and advanced merging.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why Distributed VCS Was a Breakthrough</h2>
  <p>
    Distributed VCS (DVCS) allows each contributor to keep a full local repository, which enables:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Offline work and full history access</li>
    <li>Fast branching and merging operations</li>
    <li>Flexible collaboration—peer-to-peer sharing, not relying on a central server all the time</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In DVCS, branching becomes cheap, enabling workflows with feature branches, parallel development, and experimentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, Git became especially dominant because of its performance, flexibility, large ecosystem, and support by many hosting platforms.
